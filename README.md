# Note Taker

## A simple app for making short notes and reminders.

- I wanted to make a simple, intuitive to-do list, with the ability to add, recall, and delete notes.
- It allows the user to type in simple notes and save them, click on the notes to display their text, and delete them when they are no longer needed.
